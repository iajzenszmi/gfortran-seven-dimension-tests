gfortran ffast-math runs the job slower?
ChatGPT

The -ffast-math flag in gfortran and other compilers like GCC is an option that allows the compiler to ignore certain mathematical standards to optimize floating point calculations. It's an aggressive optimization setting that allows the compiler to make certain assumptions about your code that might not always be true.

In some cases, these assumptions can lead to improved speed. But in other cases, they can introduce problems or even slowdowns. For example:

    Precision loss: -ffast-math can lead to a loss of precision in floating point calculations. If your program depends on a high degree of precision, this could lead to incorrect results.

    Inaccurate results: The -ffast-math flag allows the compiler to ignore IEEE standard. In some situations, it can produce incorrect or undefined results, which might cause your program to behave unexpectedly.

    Extra computations: -ffast-math can, in some cases, introduce extra computations that your program wouldn't normally need to do. This might actually slow down your program.

    Incompatibility with certain libraries or functions: Some mathematical libraries or functions may not work correctly, or as efficiently, with -ffast-math.

To debug why -ffast-math is slowing down your job, you could try profiling your code to see where the slowdowns are happening. You might be able to refactor your code to work better with -ffast-math, or you might decide that -ffast-math isn't the right option for your program.
